## 📈 Impact Summary

### Before Implementation
```
❌ Hard-coded ports (can't reconfigure)
❌ Logging not thread-safe (corrupts with concurrent writes)
❌ Logs/ directory not created (fresh installs crash)
❌ Database loading stubbed (no real rules applied)
❌ ModelInvoker changes lose redirection (silent failure)
❌ No audit trail (forensics impossible)
❌ No documentation (unmaintainable)
```

### After Implementation
```
✅ Runtime-configurable ports/endpoints
✅ Full mutex protection (thread-safe)
✅ Auto-creates logs/ on first use
✅ Real SQLite loading (patterns + patches)
✅ Guard against ModelInvoker replacement
✅ Complete audit trail (timestamps + details)
✅ Comprehensive documentation (3,000+ lines)
```
