Write-Host "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════" -ForegroundColor Yellow

Write-Host "`n🔄 Architecture Overview:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  1. 🖥️ Your App (RawrXD) ➜ 📡 Ollama Local Server ➜ 🌐 Cloud API ➜ 🤖 Remote Model"
Write-Host "  2. Ollama acts as a proxy/gateway to cloud services"
Write-Host "  3. Your requests get forwarded to external APIs"
Write-Host "  4. Responses come back through the same chain"

Write-Host "`n🔑 Authentication Flow:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  • Cloud models require API keys/tokens"
Write-Host "  • Ollama stores these credentials securely"
Write-Host "  • Each request includes auth headers automatically"

Write-Host "`n💰 Billing Model:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  • Pay-per-use (tokens consumed)"
Write-Host "  • Rate limits based on subscription tier"
Write-Host "  • No local storage needed (models stay in cloud)"

Write-Host "`n⚡ Performance Characteristics:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  • Latency: Higher (network roundtrip)"
Write-Host "  • Throughput: Depends on your internet & API limits"
Write-Host "  • Reliability: Depends on cloud service uptime"

Write-Host "`n🔧 How to Configure Cloud Models:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════" -ForegroundColor Yellow

Write-Host "`n1. 🔑 Get API Keys:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • GLM-4.6: Register at https://zhipuai.cn/"
Write-Host "   • MiniMax: Sign up at https://api.minimax.chat/"
Write-Host "   • Qwen Cloud: Alibaba Cloud Dashboard"

Write-Host "`n2. 🛠️ Configure Ollama:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Set environment variables:"
Write-Host "     $env:ZHIPU_API_KEY = 'your-zhipu-key'"
Write-Host "     $env:MINIMAX_API_KEY = 'your-minimax-key'"
Write-Host "     $env:DASHSCOPE_API_KEY = 'your-alibaba-key'"

Write-Host "`n3. 📥 Install Models:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ollama pull glm-4.6:cloud"
Write-Host "   ollama pull minimax-m2:cloud"

Write-Host "`n💡 Cloud vs Local Comparison:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════" -ForegroundColor Yellow

Write-Host "`n🏠 Local Models (like your bigdaddyg series):" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   ✅ No ongoing costs after download"
Write-Host "   ✅ No rate limits"
Write-Host "   ✅ Works offline"
Write-Host "   ✅ Full privacy (data stays local)"
Write-Host "   ❌ Uses your hardware resources"
Write-Host "   ❌ Limited to downloaded model size/capability"

Write-Host "`n🌐 Cloud Models:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "   ✅ Access to larger, more powerful models"
Write-Host "   ✅ No local hardware requirements"
Write-Host "   ✅ Always up-to-date model versions"
Write-Host "   ❌ Ongoing costs per usage"
Write-Host "   ❌ Rate limits"
Write-Host "   ❌ Requires internet connection"
Write-Host "   ❌ Data sent to external services"

Write-Host "`n🎯 Best Practices for Your Setup:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════" -ForegroundColor Yellow

Write-Host "`n💡 Recommended Strategy:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   1. Use your custom models (bigdaddyg, cheetah-stealth) for primary tasks"
Write-Host "   2. Use official local models (llama3, qwen3) for general work"
Write-Host "   3. Reserve cloud models for specialized tasks requiring extra power"
Write-Host "   4. Monitor cloud usage to control costs"

Write-Host "`n🔄 Fallback Strategy:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   RawrXD can be configured to:"
Write-Host "   • Try local model first"
Write-Host "   • Fall back to cloud model if local fails"
Write-Host "   • Handle rate limits gracefully"

Write-Host "`n📊 Cost Optimization:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Most of your models (15/17) are FREE!"
Write-Host "   • Your custom models are your best value"
Write-Host "   • Consider unsubscribing from unused cloud services"

Write-Host "`n🧪 Next Steps:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "════════════════════════════════════════════════════════" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "   • Configure API keys for cloud models you want to use"
Write-Host "   • Test your custom models with: .\Headless-Agentic-Test-CustomModels.ps1"
Write-Host "   • Set up fallback logic in RawrXD configuration"
Write-Host "   • Monitor usage and costs for cloud models"
