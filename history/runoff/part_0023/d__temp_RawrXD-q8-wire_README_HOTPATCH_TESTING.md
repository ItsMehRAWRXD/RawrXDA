## 🎓 Understanding the Tests

### Why These Tests Matter

**Memory Layer:**
- Validates live weight modification works
- Confirms performance impact is measurable
- Proves stability under patch modifications
- Production-critical for runtime optimization

**Byte Layer:**
- Tests persistent model modifications
- Ensures file integrity maintained
- Validates models still load after patches
- Production-critical for custom model deployment

**Server Layer:**
- Tests protocol-level transformations
- Measures inference behavior changes
- Validates response quality modifications
- Production-critical for behavior tuning

**Coordinated:**
- Tests interaction between layers
- Confirms no conflicts occur
- Validates cumulative improvements
- Production-critical for full optimization

### Real Metrics Captured

**For Each Test:**
- ✓ Baseline metric (before patch)
- ✓ Patched metric (after patch)
- ✓ Delta percentage (improvement/degradation)
- ✓ Stability (variance across runs)
- ✓ Success/failure status
- ✓ Elapsed time

**Aggregated:**
- ✓ Pass rate by layer
- ✓ Performance improvement potential
- ✓ Stability of hotpatching system
- ✓ Production readiness assessment
